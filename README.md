# Card Creation & Approval Bot (Educational Purposes)

This project is an educational tool demonstrating the creation and management of virtual cards with an approval/decline workflow via a Telegram bot.

## Overview

This tool allows users to:

1.  **Generate Cards:** Create virtual card details (for educational demonstration only).
2.  **Request Approval:** Submit these generated card details for approval.
3.  **Telegram Bot Interaction:** Interact with a Telegram bot to receive approval/decline requests.
4.  **Admin Interface (Simulated):** Simulate an admin panel where approval or decline actions can be taken.
5.  **Notification:** Receive notifications via the Telegram bot about the approval or decline status.

**Please Note:** This project is strictly for educational purposes to illustrate software development concepts. While the generated details *might* interact with trial applications or websites, potentially incurring charges if not carefully managed and requiring a good internet connection, **they are not real financial instruments and should not be used for actual transactions.** This is purely for educational exploration.

## Features

* Free card generation (educational demo).
* Approval/decline workflow simulation.
* Telegram bot integration for user and "admin" interaction.
* Clear separation of user requests and simulated admin actions.

## Getting Started (Conceptual - No Real Deployment)

This project is a conceptual demonstration. To understand how it works, you would typically:

1.  Set up the Telegram bot and obtain its token.
2.  Run the backend application that handles card generation and approval logic.
3.  Interact with the Telegram bot to create and submit "cards."
4.  Observe how the bot sends approval/decline requests and how those actions are reflected back to the user.
